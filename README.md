🌐 CRISISOS
Autonomous Crisis Intelligence System powered by Gemini
From chaos to clarity in minutes.
CRISISOS is an AI-driven crisis reasoning system that converts fragmented disaster information into clear, prioritized, life-saving decisions.
🏆 Why CRISISOS Wins
Most crisis tools display data.
CRISISOS thinks.
It reasons, prioritizes, and explains — exactly what decision-makers need when time, clarity, and lives are at stake.
🚨 The Global Problem
During disasters:
Information is unstructured, conflicting, and delayed
Human teams are overwhelmed
Critical decisions rely on intuition instead of evidence
Delays cost lives, resources, and trust
There is no autonomous reasoning layer between raw reports and executive decisions.
💡 Our Breakthrough Solution
CRISISOS introduces an AI “Command Brain” for emergencies.
Powered by Google Gemini, it:
Understands raw situation reports
Classifies crisis type & severity
Identifies hidden risks & uncertainties
Generates prioritized response actions
Continuously adapts as new intelligence arrives
