🌐 CRISISOS – Autonomous Crisis Intelligence System

CRISISOS is an AI-powered decision intelligence platform that transforms raw, unstructured crisis information into clear, prioritized, and explainable emergency actions in real time.

Problem:
During disasters, decision-makers face fragmented reports, conflicting data, limited time, and high uncertainty. Existing systems show dashboards but do not reason. This leads to delayed responses, misallocation of resources, and loss of lives.

Solution:
CRISISOS acts as an autonomous AI reasoning engine. Using Google Gemini, it analyzes incoming crisis signals, classifies severity, identifies risks and uncertainties, and generates ranked response actions with clear justification.

Key Features:
• Autonomous AI reasoning (not rule-based)
• Crisis classification with confidence score
• Prioritized response recommendations
• Risk and uncertainty analysis
• Explainable AI decisions
• Real-time adaptive intelligence

How It Works:
1. User submits a situation report or intelligence signal
2. Gemini AI processes context and uncertainty
3. Crisis type and severity are classified
4. Actionable, prioritized decisions are generated

Why Gemini:
Gemini enables deep contextual understanding, multi-step reasoning, uncertainty handling, and explainable decision logic — making CRISISOS possible.
